# Robotics in Hospitality

This section will discuss the use of robotics in automating room service, cleaning, and other tasks in hospitality.

While we recognize the importance of robotics in the future of hotel automation, this is an area where our current expertise is limited. We believe that the insights and innovations in this field are best shared by those actively engaged with the technology. If you're an industry expert, researcher, or practitioner with experience in robotics, we invite you to contribute your knowledge to help us build a comprehensive resource for the hospitality community. Your expertise could greatly benefit others looking to explore the potential of robotics in their operations. Please consider sharing your insights through our contribution guide.
