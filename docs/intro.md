# Introduction

Welcome to the Hotel Automation Framework, an initiative designed to **centralize knowledge** in hospitality automation. This framework was created out of the need for a **cohesive resource** that brings together insights scattered across blog posts, private guides, and various commercial offerings.

## Why Automation?

By automating repetitive tasks, hotels can significantly **improve operational efficiency**, **reduce costs**, and **enhance the guest experience**. Automation allows staff to focus on providing personalized service rather than getting bogged down by mundane tasks. In a highly competitive market, automation is not just an advantage—it's becoming a necessity.

## Open-source 

The content of this website is free. Everyone is welcome to view and contribute to the source-code with your industry's expertise. 

## Technology-Agnostic Approach

One of the key principles of this framework is its **technology-agnostic** approach. We do not endorse any particular software or hardware to encourage **collaboration and innovation**. Instead, we discuss possible automations and list various third-party solutions that can help you achieve them.  

## Choosing Your Level of Automation

Automation isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Hotels can implement **varying levels of automation**, depending on their size, budget, and goals. This framework presents a **broad spectrum** of automation possibilities, allowing you to **pick and choose** the solutions that best meet your specific needs.
