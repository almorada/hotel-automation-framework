# Hotel Automation Framework Documentation

Welcome to the Hotel Automation Framework documentation project!

## For Non-Technical Users

If you're unfamiliar with Git or technical setups, you can explore the Hotel Automation Framework directly on our [homepage](https://framework.almorada.es).

This website is a collaborative effort to bring together expert insights on hotel automation. Whether you're a hotel operator, software developer, or industry expert, we encourage you to contribute :)

## For Technical Users

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. Below are the instructions for setting up and running the project locally.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
